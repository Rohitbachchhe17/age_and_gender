# Age and Gender Prediction

The UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset consisting of over 20,000 images. The images cover a wide range of ages and races and include both males and females.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to create a model capable of predicting the age and gender of an individual using the UTKFace dataset. We will be focusing on part one of the cropped variations of the images, which contains almost 10,000 images. Due to memory limitations, we will only be using the first 8000 images for training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The UTKFace dataset consists of over 20,000 face images, spanning various ages, races, and genders. We will utilize a subset of this dataset, focusing on cropped images, for our model training.

## Model Training

We will detail our model architecture, training process, and any techniques employed to improve performance.

## Results

We will present the results of our model, including performance metrics for age and gender prediction, and any insights gained from the evaluation.

## Usage

Include instructions on how to use your code and reproduce the results.
